        <h3><strong>Re: Eileen Dover university application</strong></h3>
    </address>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part<br>
       of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <section>
        <h1><strong>Starting dates</strong></h1>
        <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br>
           could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
            <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
            <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
         </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="http://example.com"

        <h2><strong>Subjects of study</strong></h2>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br>
           somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
           the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
           by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br>
           research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Exotic dance moves</strong></h2>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
           my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br>
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br>
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
                modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
                discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
                of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
                because they were really cold.</dd>
        </dl>

    <p>Yours sincerely,<br>
        Dr Eleanor Gaye</p>
